Simple coding examples from university that are allowed to be shared. 
1. PhaseC.ipynb: This was part of a larger project where, given a maze, we needed to use computer vision to read the maze and map out a path for a robot to find the 'ladybug'. The robot, maze pattern and ladybug were all variables in this project. Phase A and B involved using C++ to write instructions for the robot to move. Unfortunately, due to university regulations, these code examples are not allowed to be shared.
